  High as the heavens our voices raise;
  And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

  Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space,
  His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
  And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

  3
  Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
  It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
  It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
  And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

  Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
  In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;
  Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!
  Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

  Its own appointed limits keep;
  Oh hear us when we cry to Thee
  For those in peril on the sea.

  2
  O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
  And hushed their raging at Thy word,
  Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
  And calm amidst its rage didst sleep;
  Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
  For those in peril on the sea.

  3
  O Holy Spirit, who didst brood
  Upon the waters dark and rude,
  And bid their angry tumult cease,
  And give, for wild confusion, peace:
  Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
  For those in peril on the sea.

  4
  O Trinity of love and power,
  All trav'lers shield in danger's hour;
  From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
  Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
  Thus evermore shall rise to The
  Glad humns of praise from land and sea.







































  88     I Sing the Migthy Power of God


  1
  I sing the almighty power of God,
  that made the mountains rise,
  that spread the flowing seas abroad,
  and built the lofty skies.
  I sing the wisdom that ordained
  the sun to rule the day;
  the moon shines full at God's command,
  and all the stars obey.

  2
  I sing the goodness of the Lord,
  who filled the earth with food,
  who formed the creatures thru the Word,
  and then pronounced them good.
  Lord, how thy wonders are displayed,
  where'er I turn my eye,
  if I survey the ground I tread,
  or gaze upon the sky!

  3
  There's not a plant or flower below,
  but makes thy glories known,
  and clouds arise, and tempests blow,
  by order from thy thrown;
  while all that borrows life from thee
  is ever in thy care;
  and everywhere that we can be,
  thou, God, art present there.









































  92     This Is My Father's World


  1
  This is my Father's world,
  and to my listening ears
  all nature sings, and round me rings
  the music of the spheres.
  This is my Father's world:
  I rest me in the thought
  of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
  his hand the wonders wrought.

  2
  This is my Father's world,
  the birds their carols raise,
  the morning light, the lily white,
  declare their maker's praise.
  This is my Father's world:
  he shines in all that's fair;
  in the rustling grass I hear him pass;
  he speaks to me everywhere.

  3
  This is my Father's world.
  O let me ne'er forget
  that though the wrong seems oft so strong,
  God is the ruler yet.
  This is my Father's world:
  why should my heart be sad?
  The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
  God reigns; let the earth be glad!









































  93     All Things Bright and Beautiful


  1*
  All things bright and beautiful,
  All creatures great and small,
  All things wise and wonderful,
  The Lord made them all.

  2
  Each little flower that opens,
  Each little bird that sings;
  He made their glowing colors,
  He made their tiny wings.

  3
  The purpleheaded mountain,
  The river running by
  The sunset, and the morning
  That brightens up the sky,

  4
  The cold wind in the winter,
  The pleasant summer sun,
  The ripe fruits in the garden,
  He made them every one.

  5
  He gave us eyes to see them,
  And lips that we might tell
  How great is God Almighty,
  Who has made all things well.

  *Stanza 1 to be sung as refrain after stanzas 2 to 5







































  96     The Spacious Firmament


  1
  The spacious firmament on high,
  With all the blue, ethereal sky,
  And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
  Their great Original proclaim.
  Th'unwearied sun from day to day
  Does his Creator's power display,
  And publishes to every land
  The work of an almighty hand

  2
  Soon as the evening shades prevail,
  The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
  And nightly to the listening earth
  Repeats the story of her birth;
  While all the stars that round her burn,
  And all the planets in their turn,
  Confirm the tidings as they roll,
  And spread the truth from pole to pole

  3
  What though in solemn silence all
  Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
  What though no real voice nor sound
  Amid their radiant orbs be found?
  In reason's ear they all rejoice
  And utter forth a glorious voice,
  Forever singing as they shine,
  "The hand that made us is divine."

  nothing you ask will be denied,
  God will take care of you.

  God will take care of you;
  lean, weary one, upon his breast,
  God will take care of you.

  101    Children of the Heavenly Father


  1
  Children of the heavenly Father
  Safely in His bossom gather;
  Nestling bird nor star in heaven
  Such a refuge e'er was given.

  2
  God His own doth tend and nourish,
  In His holy love they flourish;
  From all evil things He spares them,
  In His mighty arms He bears them.

  Neither life nor death shall ever
  From the Lord His children sever;
  Unto them His grace He showeth,

  At the will of your Defender
  Every foe-man must surrender.

  God His children ne'er forsaketh;
  His the loving purpose solely
  To preserve them pure and holy.









































  103    O God, Our Help in Ages Past


  1
  O God, our help in ages past,
  our hope for years to come,
  our shelter from the stormy blast,
  and our eternal home!

  2
  Under the shadow of thy throne,
  still may we dwell secure;
  sufficient is thine arm alone,
  and our defense is sure.

  3
  Before the hills in order stood,
  or earth received her frame,
  from everlasting, thou art God,
  to endless years the same.

  4
  A thousand ages, in thy sight,
  are like an evening gone;
  short as the watch that ends the night,
  before the rising sun.

  5
  O God, our help in ages past,
  our hope for years to come;
  be thou our guide while life shall last,
  and our eternal home!









































  108    Amazing Grace


  1
  Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
  that saved a wretch like me!
  I once was lost, but now am found;
  was blind, but now I see.

  2
  'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
  and grace my fears relieved;
  how precious did that grace appear
  the hour I first believed.

  3
  The Lord has promised good to me,
  his word my hope secures;
  he will my shield and portion be,
  as long as life endures.

  4
  Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
  I have already come;
  'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
  and grace will lead me home.

  5
  When we've been there ten thousand years,
  bright shining as the sun,
  we've no less days to sing God's praise
  than when we first begun.









































  109    Marvelous Grace


  1
  Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.
  Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
  Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured
  There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

  Refrain
  Grace, grace,God's grace,
  Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
  Grace, grace, God's grace,
  Grace that is greater than all our sin!

  Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
  Grace that is greater yes grace untold
  Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

  3
  Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
  Freely bestowed on all who believe!
  You that are longing to see His face,
  Will you this moment His grace receive?

  O come, O come, Immanuel,
  And ransom captive Israel
  That mourns in lonely exile here
  Until the Son of God appear.

  Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
  Shall come to thee, O Israel!

  All peoples in one heart and mind;
  Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;
  Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.

















































  118    The First Noel


  1
  The first noel the angel did say
  Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay;
  In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
  On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

  Refrain
  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
  Born is the King of Israel

  2
  They looked up and say a star
  Shining in the east, beyond them far,
  And to the earth it gave great light,
  And so it continued both day and night.

  3
  And by the light of that same star,
  Three wise men came from country far,
  And to the earth it gave great light,
  And to follow the star wherever it went.

  4
  This star drew nigh to the northwest,
  O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
  And there it did both stop and stay,
  Right over the place where Jesus lay.

  5
  Then entered in those wise men three,
  Full reverently upon the knee,
  And offered there, in His presence,
  Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.





































  119    Angels From the Realms of Glory


  1
  Angels from the realms of glory,
  Wing your flight o`er all the earth;
  Ye, who sang creation`s story,
  Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;
  Come and worship, Come and worship,
  Worship Christ, the newborn King.

  2
  Shepherds, in the field abiding,
  Watching o`er your flocks by night,
  God with man is now residing;
  Yonder shines the Infant Light;
  Come and worship, Come and worship,
  Worship Christ, the newborn King.

  3
  Sages, leave your contemplations,
  Brighter visions beam afar;
  Seek the great Desire of nations;
  Ye have seen His natal star;
  Come and worship, Come and worship,
  Worship Christ, the newborn King.

  4
  Saints, before the altar bending,
  Watching long in hope and fear,
  Suddenly the Lord, descending,
  In His temple shall appear;
  Come and worship, Come and worship,
  Worship Christ, the newborn King.







































  120    There's a Song in the Air


  1
  There's a song in the air!
  There's a star in the sky!
  There's a mother's deep prayer
  And a baby's low cry!
  And the star rains its fire
  while the beautiful sing,
  For the manger of Bethlehem
  cradles a King!

  2
  There's a tumult of joy
  O'er the wonderful birth,
  For the virgin's sweet boy
  Is the Lord of the earth.
  Aye! the star rains its fire
  while the beautiful sing,
  For the manger of Bethlehem
  cradles a King!

  3
  In the light of that star
  Lie the ages impearled;
  And that song from afar
  Has swept over the world.
  Every hearth is aflame
  and the beautiful sing
  In the homes of the nations
  that Jesus is King!

  4
  We rejoice in the light,
  And we echo the song
  That comes down through the night
  From the heavenly throng.
  Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,
  And we greet in His cradle
  our Savior and King!
































  122    Hark! the Herald Angels Sing


  1
  Hark! the herald angels sing,
  "Glory to the new born King,
  peace on earth, and mercy mild,
  God and sinners reconciled!"
  Joyful, all ye nations rise,
  join the triumph of the skies;
  with th' angelic host proclaim,
  "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
  Hark! the herald angels sing,
  "Glory to the new born King!"

  2
  Christ, by highest heaven adored;
  Christ, the everlasting Lord;
  late in time behold him come,
  offspring of a virgin's womb.
  Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
  hail th' incarnate Deity,
  pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
  Jesus, our Emmanuel.
  Hark! the herald angels sing,
  "Glory to the new born King!"

  3
  Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
  Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
  Light and life to all he brings,
  risen with healing in his wings.
  Mild he lays his glory by,
  born that we no more may die,
  born to raise us from the earth,
  born to give us second birth.
  Hark! the herald angels sing,
  "Glory to the new born King!"



































  123    As With Gladness Men of Old


  1
  As with gladness, men of old
  Did the guiding star behold
  As with joy they hailed its light
  Leading onward, beaming bright
  So, most glorious Lord, may we
  Evermore be led to Thee.

  2
  As with joyful steps they sped
  To that lowly manger bed
  There to bend the knee before
  Him Whom heaven and earth adore;
  So may we with willing feet
  Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

  3
  As they offered gifts most rare
  At that manger rude and bare;
  So may we with holy joy,
  Pure and free from sin's alloy,
  All our costliest treasures bring,
  Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

  4
  Holy Jesus, every day
  Keep us in the narrow way;
  And, when earthly things are past,
  Bring our ransomed souls at last
  Where they need no star to guide,
  Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

  5
  In the heavenly country bright,
  Need they no created light;
  Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
  Thou its sun which goes not down;
  There forever may we sing
  Alleluias to our King!































  125    Joy to the World


  1
  Joy to the world,
  the Lord is come!
  Let earth
  receive her King;
  Let every heart
  prepare Him room,
  And heaven and nature sing,
  And heaven and nature sing,
  And heaven, and heaven
  and nature sing.

  2
  Joy to the earth,
  the Savior reigns!
  Let men their
  songs employ;
  While fields and floods,
  rocks, hills, and plains,
  Repeat the sounding joy,
  Repeat the sounding joy,
  Repeat, repeat
  the sounding joy.

  3
  No more let sin
  and sorrow grow,
  Nor thorns
  infest the ground;
  He comes to make
  His blessings flow
  Far as the curse is found,
  Far as the curse is found,
  Far as, far as
  the curse is found.

  4
  He rules the world
  with truth and grace,
  And makes the
  nations prove
  The glories of
  His righteousness,
  And wonders of His love,
  And wonders of His love,
  And wonders, and
  wonders of His love.































  128    Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light


  1
  Break forth, O beautiful heavenly light,
  And usher in the morning;
  Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,
  But hear the abgel's warning.
  This child, now weak in infancy,
  Our confidence and joy shall be,
  The power of Satan breaking,
  Our peace eternal making.

  2
  Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light
  To herald our salvation;
  He stoops to earth-the God of might,
  Our hope and expectation.
  He comes in human flesh to dwell,
  Our God with us, Immanuel,
  The night of darkness ending,
  Our fallen race befriending.











































  130    It Came Upon the Midnight Clear


  1
  It came upon the midnight clear,
  that glorious song of old,
  from angels bending near the earth
  to touch their harps of gold;
  "Peace on earth, goodwill to men,
  from heav'n's all gracious King!"
  The world in solemn stillness lay
  to hear the angels sing.

  2
  Still through the cloven skies they come,
  with peaceful wings unfurled;
  And still their heav'nly music floats
  o'er all the weary world;
  Above its sad and lowly plains
  they bend on hovering wing;
  And ever o'er its Babel sounds
  the blessed angels sing!

  3
  Yet with the woes of sin and strife
  the world has suffered long;
  beneath the angel strain have rolled
  two thousand years of wrong;
  And man, at war with man, hears not
  the love song which they bring
  O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
  and hear the angels sing!

  4
  For lo! The days are hast'ning on,
  by prophet bards foretold,
  When, with the ever circling years,
  comes round the age of gold;
  When peace shall over all the earth
  its ancient splendors fling;
  And the whole world send back
  the song which now the angels sing!































  131    Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming


  1
  Lo, how a rose e're blooming
  From tenderstem hath sprung,
  Of Jesse's lineage coming
  As men of old have sung.
  It came, a floweret bright,
  Amid the cold of winter
  When half spent was the night.

  2
  Isaiah 'twas foretold it,
  The Rose I have in mind,
  With Mary we beheld it,
  The virgin mother kind.
  To show God's love aright
  She bore to them a Savior,
  When half spent was the night.





















































  132    O Come, All Ye Faithful


  1
  O come, all ye faithful,
  joyful and triumphant,
  O come ye, O come
  ye to Bethlehem!
  Come and behold Him,
  born the King of angels!
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore
  Him, Christ, the Lord!

  2
  Sing, choirs of angels
  sing in exultation,
  O sing all ye citizens
  of heaven above!
  Glory to God, all
  glory in the highest!
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore
  Him, Christ, the Lord!

  3
  Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
  born this happy morning,
  Jesus, to Thee be
  all glory given;
  Word of the Father,
  now in flesh appearing!
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore
  Him, Christ, the Lord!



































  135    O Little Town of Bethlehem


  1
  O little town of Bethlehem
  How still we see thee lie!
  Above thy deep and dreamless
  sleep The silent stars go by;
  Yet in thy dark streets shineth
  The everlasting light;
  The hopes and fears of all the
  years Are met in thee tonight.

  2
  For Christ is born of Mary;
  And gathered all above,
  While mortals sleep,
  the angels keep
  Their watch of
  wondering love.
  O morning stars, together
  Proclaim the holy birth!
  And praises sing to God the King,
  And peace to men on earth.

  3
  How silently, how silently
  The wondrous gift is given!
  So God imparts to human hearts
  The blessings of His heaven.
  No ear may hear His coming;
  But in this world of sin,
  Where meek souls will
  recieve Him still,
  The dear Christ
  enters in.

  4
  O holy Child of Bethlehem,
  Descend to us, we pray;
  Cast out our sin and enter
  in-- Be born in us today.
  We hear the Christmas angels
  The great glad tidings tell--
  Oh, come to us, abide with us,
  Our Lord Immanuel!




























  137    We Three Kings


  1
  We three kings of Orient are;
  Bearing gifts we traverse afar
  Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
  Following yonder star.

  Refrain
  O star of wonder, star of night,
  Star with royal beauty bright,
  Westward leading, still proceeding,
  Guide us to Thy perfect light.

  2
  Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
  Gold I bring to crown Him again,
  King forever, ceasing never
  Over us all to reign.

  3
  Frankincense to offer have I;
  Incense owns a Deity nigh;
  Prayer and praising all men raising,
  Worship Him, God on high.

  4
  Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
  Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
  Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
  Sealed in the stonecold tomb.

  5
  Glorious now behold Him arise,
  King and God and sacrifice;
  Alleluia, Alleluia!
  Sounds through the earth and skies.


































  138    Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow


  1
  There's a star in the east on Christmas morn.
  Rise up shepherd, and follow.
  It will lead to the place where the Savior's born,
  Rise up shepherd, and follow.

  Refrain
  Leave your sheep and leave your lambs,
  Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
  Leave your ewes and leave your rams,
  Rise up shepherd, and follow.
  Follow, follow, Rise up, shepherd and follow.
  Follow the star of Behlehem, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

  2
  If you take good heed to the angel's words,
  Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
  You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds,
  Rise up, shepherd, and follow.



















































  141    What Child Is This?


  1
  What child is this, who, laid to rest,
  On Mary`s lap is sleeping?
  Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
  While shepherds watch are keeping?

  Refrain
  This, this is Christ the King,
  Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
  Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
  The babe, the son of Mary.

  2
  Why lies He in such mean estate
  Where ox and ass are feeding?
  Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
  The silent Word is pleading.

  3
  So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
  Come, peasant, king, to own Him,
  The King of kings salvation brings,
  Let loving hearts enthrone Him.















































  142    Angels We Have Heard on High


  1
  Angels we have heard on high,
  Singing sweetly through the night,
  And the mountains, in reply,
  Echoing their brave delight.

  Refrain
  Gloria, in excelsis Deo,
  Gloria in excelsis Deo.

  2
  Shepherds, why this jubilee?
  Why this songs of happy cheer?
  What great brightness did you see?
  What glad tidings did you hear?

  3
  Come to Bethlehem and see
  Him whose birth the angels sing;
  Come adore, on bended knee,
  Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

  4
  See Him in a manger laid,
  Whom the angels praise above;
  Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
  While we raise our hearts in love.











































  143    Silent Night, Holy Night


  1
  Silent night! holy night!
  All is calm, all is bright
  Round yon virgin mother and Child,
  Holy Infant so tender and mild,
  Sleep in heavenly peace,
  sleep in heavenly peace.

  2
  Silent night! holy night!
  Shepherds quake at the sight,
  glories stream from heaven afar,
  heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
  Christ, the Savior is born,
  Christ, the Savior is born.

  3
  Silent night! holy night!
  Son of God, love's pure light,
  Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
  with the dawn of redeeming grace,
  Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
  Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.















































  146    I Think When I Read That Sweet Story


  1
  I think when I read that sweet story of old,
  When Jesus was here among men,
  How He called little children
  as lambs to His fold,
  I should like to have been with Him then.

  2
  I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
  That His arm had been thrown around me,
  And that I might have seen His kind
  look when He said,
  "Let the little ones come unto Me."

  3
  I long for the joy of that glorious time,
  The sweetest and brightest and best,
  When the dear little children of every clime
  Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.



















































  152    Tell Me the Story of Jesus


  1
  Tell me the story of Jesus,
  Write on my heart every word,
  Tell me the story most precious
  Sweetest that ever was heard;
  Tell how the angels, in chorus,
  Sang as they welcomed His birth,
  Glory to God in the highest,
  Peace and good tidings to earth.

  Refrain
  Tell me the story of Jesus,
  Write on my heart every word,
  Tell me the story most precious,
  Sweetest that ever was heard.

  2
  Fasting, alone in the desert,
  Tell of the days that He passed,
  How for our sins He was tempted,
  Yet was triumphant at last;
  Tell of the years of His labor,
  Tell of the sorrow He bore,
  He was despised and afflicted,
  Homeless, rejected, and poor.

  3
  Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
  Writhing in anguish and pain;
  Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
  Tell how He liveth again;
  Love in that story so tender,
  Clearer than ever I see;
  Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
  Love paid the ransom for me.



































  154    When I Survey the Wondrous Cross


  1
  When I survey the wondrous cross
  on which the Prince of Glory died;
  my richest gain I count but loss,
  and pour contempt on all my pride.

  2
  Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
  save in the death of Christ, my God;
  all the vain things that charm me most,
  I sacrifice them to his blood.

  3
  See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
  sorrow and love flow mingled down.
  Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
  or thorns compose so rich a crown.

  4
  Were the whole realm of nature mine,
  that were an offering far too small;
  love so amazing, so divine,
  demands my soul, my life, my all.















































  156    O Sacred Head Now Wounded

  O sacred Head, now wounded,
  with grief and shame weighed down,
  now scornfully surounded
  with thorns, thine only crown:
  how pale thou art with anguish,
  with sore abuse and scorn!
  How does that visage languish
  which once was bright as morn!

  2
  What thou, my Lord, has suffered
  was all for sinners' gain;
  mine, mine was the transgression,
  but thine the deadly pain.
  Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
  'Tis I deserve thy place;
  look on me with thy favor,
  vouchsafe to me thy grace.

  3
  What language shall I borrow
  to thank thee, dearest friend,
  for this thy dying sorrow,
  thy pity without end?
  O make me thine forever;
  and should I fainting be,
  Lord, let me never, never
  outlive my love for thee.









































  157    Go to Dark Gethsemane


  1
  Go to dark Gethsemane,
  ye that feel the tempter's power;
  your Redeemer's conflict see,
  watch with him one bitter hour.
  Turn not from his griefs away;
  learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

  2
  See him at the judgment hall,
  beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
  O the wormwood and the gall!
  O the pangs his soul sustained!
  Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
  learn of Christ to bear the cross.

  3
  Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
  there, adoring at his feet,
  mark that miracle of time,
  God's own sacrifice complete.
  "It is finished!" hear him cry;
  learn of Jesus Christ to die.















































  159    The Old Rugged Cross


  1
  On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
  the emblem of suffering and shame;
  and I love that old cross where the dearest and best
  for a world of lost sinners was slain.

  Refrain
  So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
  till my trophies at last I lay down;
  I will cling to the old rugged cross,
  and exchange it some day for a crown.

  2
  O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
  has a wondrous attraction for me;
  for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above
  to bear it to dark Calvary.

  3
  To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
  its shame and reproach gladly bear;
  then he'll call me some day to my home far away,
  where his glory forever I'll share.















































  163    At the Cross


  1
   Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
  and did my Sovereign die?
  Would he devote that sacred head
  for sinners such as I?

  Refrain
  At the cross, at the cross,
  where I first saw the light,
  and the burden of my heart rolled away;
  it was there by faith I received my sight,
  and now I am happy all the day!

  2
  Was it for crimes that I have done,
  he groaned upon the tree?
  Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
  And love beyond degree!

  3
  But drops of grief can ne'er repay
  the debt of love I owe:
  Here, Lord, I give myself away;
  'tis all that I can do!














































  166    Christ the Lord Is Risen Today

  Made like him, like him we rise, Alleluia!
  Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!















































  171    Thine Is the Glory


  1
  Thine is the glory,
  Risen, conquering Son;
  Endless is the victory
  Thou o'er death hast won.
  Angels in bright raiment
  Rolled the stone away,
  Kept the folded grave-clothes
  Where Thy body lay.

  Refrain
  Thine is the glory,
  Risen, conquering Son;
  Endless is the victory
  Thou o'er death hast won.

  2
  Lo! Jesus meets us.
  Risen from the tomb,
  Lovingly He greets us,
  Scatters fear and gloom;
  Let His Church with gladness
  Hymns of triumph sing,
  For her Lord now liveth;
  Death has lost its sting.

  3
  No more we doubt Thee,
  Glorious Prince of life!
  Life is nought without Thee;
  Aid us in our strife;
  Make us more than conquerors,
  Through Thy deathless love;
  Bring us safe through Jordan
  To Thy home above.



































  181    Does Jesus Care?


  1
  Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
  Too deeply for mirth and song;
  As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
  And the way grows weary and long?

  Refrain
  O yes, He cares- I know He cares!
  His heart is touched with my grief;
  When the days are weary,
  The long nights dreary,
  I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)

  2
  Does Jesus care when my way is dark
  With a nameless dread and fear?
  As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
  Does He care enough to be near?

  3
  Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye
  To the dearest on earth to me,
  And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks -
  Is it aught to Him? Does He see?














































  182    Christ Is Alive


  1
  Christ is alive!
  Let Christians sing.
  His cross stands empty to the sky.
  Let streets and homes with praises ring.
  His love in death shall never die.

  2
  Christ is alive!
  No longer bound
  To distant years in Palestine,
  He comes to claim the here and now
  And conquer every place and time.

  3
  In every insult,
  rift, and war
  Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
  He suffers still, yet loves the more,
  And lives, though ever crucified.

  4
  Christ is alive!
  Ascended Lord
  He rules the world His Father made,
  Till, in the end, His love adored
  Shall be to all on earth displayed.











































  183    I Will Sing of Jesus' Love


  1
  I Will sing of Jesus love,
  Sing of Him,who first loved me;
  for He left bright worlds above,
  And died on Calvary.

  Refrain
  I will sing of Jesus love
  Endless praise my heart shall give;
  He has died that I might live
  I will sing His love to me.

  2
  O the depths of love divine!
  Earth or heaven can never know
  How that sin as dark as mine
  can be made as white as snow.

  3
  Nothing good for Him I've done;
  How could He such love bestow?
  Lord, I own my heart is won,
  help me now my love to show.















































  184    Jesus Paid It All


  1
  I hear the Savior say,
  "Thy strength indeed is small;
  Child of weakness, watch and pray,
  Find in Me thine all in all."

  Refrain
  Jesus paid it all,
  All to Him I owe;
  Sin had left a crimson stain;
  He washed it white as snow.

  2
  Lord, now indeed I find
  Thy power, and Thine alone,
  Can change the leper's spots,
  And melt the heart of stone.

  3
  Since nothing good have I
  Whereby Thy grace to claim,
  I'll wash my garment white
  In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

  4
  And when before the throne
  I stand in Him complete,
  I'll lay my trophies down,
  All down at Jesus' feet.









































  185    Jesus Is All the World to Me


  1
  Jesus is all the world to me,
  my life, my joy, my all;
  he is my strength from day to day,
  without him I would fall.
  When I am sad, to him I go,
  no other one can cheer me so;
  when I am sad, he makes me glad,
  he's my friend.

  2
  Jesus is all the world to me,
  my friend in trials sore;
  I go to him for blessings, and
  he gives them o'er and o'er.
  He sends the sunshine and the rain,
  he sends the harvest's golden grain;
  sunshine and rain, harvest of grain,
  he's my friend.

  3
  Jesus is all the world to me,
  and true to him I'll be;
  O how could I this friend deny,
  when he's so true to me?
  Following him I know I'm right,
  he watches o'er me day and night;
  following him by day and night,
  he's my friend.

  4
  Jesus is all the world to me,
  I want no better friend;
  I trust him now, I'll trust him when
  life's fleeting days shall end.
  Beautiful life with such a friend,
  beautiful life that has no end;
  eternal life, eternal joy,
  he's my friend.































  186    I've Found a Friend


  1
  I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
  He loved me ere I knew Him;
  He drew me with the cords of love,
  And thus He bound me to Him.
  And 'round my heart still closely twine
  Those ties which nought can sever,
  For I am His, and He is mine,
  Forever and forever.

  2
  I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
  He bled, He died to save me;
  And not alone the gift of life,
  But His own self He gave me.
  Nought that I have my own I call,
  I hold it for the Giver;
  My heart, my strength, my life my all,
  Are His, and His forever.

  3
  I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
  All power to Him is given;
  To guard me on my upward course,
  And bring me safe to heaven.
  The eternal glories gleam afar,
  To nerve my faint endeavor;
  So now to watch, to work, to war,
  And then to rest forever.

  4
  I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
  So kind, and true, and tender,
  So wise a counselor and guide,
  So mighty a defender.
  From Him, who loveth me so well,
  What power my soul can sever?
  Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?
  No; I am His forever.































  190    Jesus Loves Me

  Jesus loves me! this I know,
  For the Bible tells me so;

  They are weak but He is strong

  Yes, Jesus loves me!
  Yes, Jesus loves me!
  Yes, Jesus loves me!
  The Bible tells me so.

  2

  Heaven's gate to open wide:
  He will wash away my sin,
  Let His little child come in.

  Make it pure and wholly thine;
  On the coross You died for me,
  I will love and live for Thee.















































  191    Love Divine


  1
  Love divine, all loves excelling,
  joy of heaven, to earth come down;
  fix in us thy humble dwelling;
  all thy faithful mercies crown!
  Jesus thou art all compassion,
  pure, unbounded love thou art;
  visit us with thy salvation;
  enter every trembling heart.

  2
  Breathe, O breathe thy loving Spirit
  into every troubled breast!
  Let us all in thee inherit;
  let us find that second rest.
  Take away our bent to sinning;
  Alpha and Omega be;
  end of faith, as its beginning,
  set our hearts at liberty.

  3
  Come, Almighty to deliver,
  let us all thy life receive;
  suddenly return and never,
  nevermore thy temples leave.
  Thee we would be always blessing,
  serve thee as thy hosts above,
  pray and praise thee without ceasing,
  glory in thy perfect love.

  4
  Finish, then, thy new creation;
  pure and spotless let us be.
  Let us see thy great salvation
  perfectly restored in thee;
  changed from glory into glory,
  till in heaven we take our place,
  till we cast our crowns before thee,
  lost in wonder, love, and praise.































  195    Showers of Blessing


  1
  "There shall be showers of blessing;"
  This is the promise of love;
  There shall be seasons refreshing,
  Sent from the Savior above.

  Refrain
  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.

  2
  "There shall be showers of blessing;"
  Precious reviving again;
  Over the hills and the valleys,
  Sound of abundance of rain.

  3
  "There shall be showers of blessing;"
  Send them upon us, O Lord;
  Grant to us now a refreshing;
  Come, and now honor Thy word.

  4
  "There shall be showers of blessing;"
  O that today they might fall,
  Now as to God were confessing,
  Now as on Jesus we call!









































  196    Tell Me the Old, Old Story


  1
  Tell me the old, old story, Of unseen things above,
  Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love;
  Tell me the story simply, As to a little child,
  For I am weak and weary, And helpless and defiled.

  2
  Tell me the story softly, With earnest tones and grave;
  Remember I'm the sinner Whom Jesus came to save;
  Tell me the story always, If you would really be,
  In any time of trouble, A comforter to me.

  3
  Tell me the same old story, When you have cause to fear
  That this world's empty glory Is costing me too dear;
  Yes, and when that world's glory Is dawning on my soul,
  Tell me the old, old story: "Christ Jesus makes thee whole."





















































  198    And Can It Be?


  1
  And can it be that I should gain
  an interest in the Savior's blood!
  Died he for me? who caused his pain!
  For me? who him to death pursued?
  Amazing love! How can it be
  that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

  Refrain
  Amazing love! How can it be
  that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

  2
  He left his Father's throne above
  so free, so infinite his grace!;
  emptied himself of all but love,
  and bled for Adam's helpless race.
  'Tis mercy all, immense and free,
  for O my God, it found out me!

  3
  Long my imprisoned sprit lay,
  fast bound in sin and nature's night;
  thine eye diffused a quickening ray;
  I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
  my chains fell off, my heart was free,
  I rose, went forth, and followed thee.

  4
  No condemnation now I dread;
  Jesus, and all in him, is mine;
  alive in him, my living Head,
  and clothed in righteousnes divine,
  bold I approach th' eternal throne,
  and claim the crown, through Christ my own.

  Look for the dawning rays.

  joy of every longing heart.

  born a child and yet a King,

  By thine own eternal spirit
  rule in all our hearts alone;

  raise us to thy glorious throne.

  to the nations round;
  The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
  and the trumpet sound.

  the Judge will come, and will take his people
  where they will not die.

  Far beyond the starry sky;
  Face to face in all His glory
  I shall see Him by and by!

  Only faintly now I see Him,
  With the darkening veil between,
  But a blessed day is coming,
  When His glory shall be seen.

  3
  What rejoicing in His presence,
  When are banished grief and pain;
  When the crooked ways are straightened,
  And the dark things shall be plain!

  Face to face to see and know;
  Face to face with my Redeemer,
  Jesus Christ, who loves me so.

  To receive from the world His own.

  Ere we shout the glad song?
  Christ returneth, Hallelujah!

  Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
  When Jesus receives His own.

  Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!

  To praise Thee ages all along.

  At mysteries so great.

  whose power a scepter sways
  from pole to pole, that wars may cease,
  and all be prayer and praise.

  fair flowers of paradise extend
  their fragrance ever sweet.

  Creator of the rolling spheres,

  throughout eternity.

  made sweet hosannas ring.
  Thou art the King of Israel,
  thou David's royal Son,
  who in the Lord's name comest,
  the King and Blessed One.

  2
  The company of angels
  are praising thee on high,
  and we with all creation
  in chorus make reply.
  The people of the Hebrews
  with psalms before thee went;
  our prayer and praise and anthems
  before thee we present.

  3
  To thee, before thy passion,
  they sang their hymns of praise;
  to thee, now high exalted,
  our melody we raise.
  Thou didst accept their praises;
  accept the prayers we bring,
  who in all good delightest,
  thou good and gracious King.

  triumph o'er the shades of night;
  Dayspring from on high, be near;
  Daystar, in my heart appear.

  2
  Dark and cheerless is the morn
  unaccompanied by thee;
  joyless is the day's return,
  till thy mercy's beams I see;
  till they inward light impart,
  cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

  3
  Visit then this soul of mine;
  pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
  fill me, Radiancy divine,
  scatter all my unbelief;
  more and more thyself display,
  shining to the perfect day.

  But how much I love Thee
  my actions will show.

  2
  I'm happy, I'm happy,
  O, wondrous account!
  My joys are immortal,
  I stand on the mount!
  I gaze on my treasure
  and long to be there,
  With Jesus and angles,
  and kindred so dear.

  3
  O Jesus, my Savior,
  with Thee I am blest,
  My life and salvation,
  my joy and my rest:
  Thy name by my theme,
  and Thy love be my song;
  Thy grace shall inspire both
  my heart and my tongue.

  4
  O, who's like my Savior?
  He's Salem's bright King;
  He smiles, and He loves me,
  and helps me to sing.

  with notes loud and clear,
  While rivers of pleasure
  my spirit do cheer.

  hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
  never shall the cross forsake me.
  Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

  3
  When the sun of bliss is beaming
  light and love upon my way,
  from the cross the radiance streaming
  adds more luster to the day.

  Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
  by the cross are sanctified;
  peace is there that knows no measure,
  joys that through all time abide.















































  239    Jesus, Priceless Treasure


  1
  Jesus, priceless treasure,
  source of purest pleasure,
  truest friend to me,
  long my heart hath panted,
  till it well-nigh fainted,
  thirsting after thee.
  Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
  I will suffer naught to hide thee,
  ask for naught beside thee.

  2
  In thine arms I rest me;
  foes who would molest me
  cannot reach me here.
  Though the earth be shaking,
  every heart be quaking,
  Jesus calms our fear;
  sin and hell in conflict fell
  with their heaviest storms assail us;
  Jesus will not fail us.

  3
  Hence, all thoughts of sadness!
  For the Lord of gladness,
  Jesus, enters in.
  Those who love the Father,
  through the storms may gather,
  still have peace within;
  yea, whate'er we here must bear,
  still in thee lies purest pleasure,
  Jesus, priceless treasure!

  who makes the woeful heart to sing.

  and all the twinkling starry host:
  Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
  than all the angels heaven can boast.

  4
  Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations,
  Son of God and Son of Man!
  Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
  now and forevermore be thine!















































  241    Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee


  1
  Jesus, the very thought of thee
  with sweetness fills the breast;
  but sweeter far thy face to see,
  and in thy presence rest.

  2
  No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
  Nor can the memory find
  A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
  The Savior of mankind.

  3
  O hope of every contrite heart!
  O joy of all the meek,
  to those who fall, how kind thou art!
  How good to those who seek!

  4
  But what to those who find? Ah, this
  nor tongue nor pen can show;
  the love of Jesus, what it is,
  none but his loved ones know.

  as thou our prize wilt be;
  Jesus, be thou our glory now,
  and through eternity.

  257    Come Down, O Love Divine


  1
  Come down, O Love divine,
  seek thou this soul of mine,
  and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;
  O Comforter, draw near,
  within my heart appear,
  and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.

  2
  O let it freely burn,
  till earthly passions turn
  to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
  and let thy glorious light
  shine ever on my sight,
  and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

  3
  Let holy charity
  Mine outward vesture be,
  and lowliness become my inner clothing;
  True lowliness of heart
  Which takes the humbler part,
  And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

  4
  And so the yearning strong,
  with which the soul will long,
  shall far outpass the power of human telling;
  for none can guess its grace,
  till Love create a place
  wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.







































  266    Spirit of God


  1
  Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
  wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;
  stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art,
  and make me love thee as I ought to love.

  2
  I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,
  no sudden rending of the veil of clay,
  no angel visitant, no opening skies;
  but take the dimness of my soul away.

  3
  Has thou not bid me love thee, God and King?
  All, all thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.
  I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.
  O let me seek thee, and O let me find.

  4
  Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh;
  teach me the struggles of the soul to bear.
  To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh,
  teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

  5
  Teach me to love thee as thine angels love,
  one holy passion filling all my frame;
  the kindling of the heaven-descended Dove,
  my heart an altar, and thy love the flame.









































  268    Holy Spirit, Light Divine


  1
  Holy Spirit, light divine,
  Shine upon this heart of mine,

  Holy Spirit, power divine,
  Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
  Long has sin, without control,
  Held dominion o'er my soul.

  3
  Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
  Cheer this saddened heart of mine,
  Bid my many woes depart,
  Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

  Holy Spirit, all divine,
  Dwell within this heart of mine,
  Cast down every idol throne,
  Reign supreme, and reign alone.

  as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;
  then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall;
  and I shall find my peace, my all in all.

  3
  Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;
  Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me;
  Give me to eat and live With Thee above;
  Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.

  4
  Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak;
  I hasten to obey, But I am weak;
  Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;
  Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.















































  272    Give Me the Bible


  1
  Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,
  To cheer the wanderer lone and tempest tossed,
  No storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming
  Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.

  Refrain
  Give me the Bible-holy message shining,
  Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.
  Precept and promise, law and love combining,
  'Til night shall vanish in eternal day.

  2
  Give me the Bible when my heart is broken,
  When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear,
  Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken,
  Hold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.

  3
  Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,
  Teach me the danger of these realms below,
  That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,
  That light alone the path of peace can show.

  that from the hallowed page,
  a lantern to our footsteps,
  shines on from age to age.

  2
  The church from her dear Master
  received the gift divine,
  and still that light is lifted
  o'er all the earth to shine.
  It is the sacred vessel
  where gems of truth are stored;
  it is the heaven-drawn picture
  of Christ, the living Word.

  3
  It floateth like a banner
  before God's host unfurled;
  it is a shining beacon
  above the darkling world.
  It is the chart and compass
  that o'er life's surging tide,
  mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
  Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

  4
  O make Thy church, dear Savior,
  a lamp of purest gold,
  to bear before the nations
  your true light as of old.
  O teach your wandering pilgrims
  by this their path to trace,
  till, clouds and darkness ended,
  they see Thee face to face.

  All the fitness He requireth
  Is to feel your need of Him.

  Lo! th'incarnate God, ascended,
  Pleads the merit of His blood;
  Venture on Him, venture wholly,
  Let no other trust intrude.









































  281    I Gave My Life for Thee


  1
  I gave my life for thee,
  My precious blood I shed,
  That thou might'st ransom be,
  And quickened from the dead;
  I gave, I gave My life for thee,
  What hast thou given for Me?
  I gave, I gave My life for thee,
  What hast thou given for Me?

  2
  My Fathers house of light,
  My glory circled throne,
  I left for earthly night,
  For wanderings sad and lone;
  I left, I left it all for thee,
  Hast thou left aught for Me?
  I left, I left it all for thee,
  Hast thou left aught for Me?

  3
  I suffered much for thee,
  more than thy tongue can tell,
  Of bitterest agony,
  To rescue thee from hell;
  I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
  What hast thou borne for Me?
  I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
  What hast thou borne for Me?









































  284    For You I Am Praying

  from each idol that would keep us,

  days of toil and hours of ease,
  still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
  "Christian, love me more than these!"

  300    Rock of Ages


  1
  Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
  let me hide myself in Thee;
  let the water and the blood,
  from thy riven side which flowed,
  be of sin the double cure;
  cleanse me from its guilt and power.

  2
  Not the labors of my hands
  can fulfill thy law's demands;
  could my zeal no respite know,
  could my tears forever flow,
  all for sin could not atone;
  thou must save, and thou alone.

  3
  When my pilgrimage I close,
  Victor o'er the last of foes,
  When I soar to worlds unknown,
  and behold Thee on Thy throne,
  Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
  let me hide myself in Thee.















































  301    Near, Still Nearer


  1
  Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
  Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
  Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
  Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,
  Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.

  2
  Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
  Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-
  Only my sinful now contrite heart,
  Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
  Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

  3
  Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;
  Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
  All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
  Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
  Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

  4
  Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;
  Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
  Through endless ages, ever to be,
  Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
  Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.











































  303    Beneath the Cross of Jesus


  1
  Beneath the cross of Jesus
  I fain would take my stand,
  the shadow of a mighty rock
  within a weary land;
  a home within the wilderness,
  a rest upon the way,
  from the burning of the noontide heat,
  and the burden of the day.

  2
  Upon that cross of Jesus
  mine eye at times can see
  the very dying form of One
  who suffered there for me;
  and from my stricken heart with tears
  two wonders I confess:
  the wonders of redeeming love
  and my unworthiness.

  3
  I take, O cross, thy shadow
  for my abiding place;
  I ask no other sunshine than
  the sunshine of his face;
  content to let the world go by,
  to know no gain nor loss,
  my sinful self my only shame,
  my glory all the cross.









































  306    Draw Me Nearer


  1
  I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,
  and it told thy love to me;
  but I long to rise in the arms of faith
  and be closer drawn to thee.

  Refrain
  Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  to the cross where thou hast died.
  Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  to thy precious, bleeding side.

  2
  Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,
  by the power of grace divine;
  let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
  and my will be lost in thine.

  3
  O the pure delight of a single hour
  that before thy throne I spend,
  when I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God,
  I commune as friend with friend!















































  309    I Surrender All


  1
  All to Jesus I surrender;
  all to him I freely give;
  I will ever love and trust him,
  in his presence daily live.

  Refrain
  I surrender all, I surrender all,
  all to thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.

  2
  All to Jesus I surrender;
  humbly at his feet I bow,
  worldly pleasures all forsaken;
  take me, Jesus, take me now.

  3
  All to Jesus I surrender;
  make me, Savior, wholly thine;
  fill me with thy love and power;
  truly know that thou art mine.

  4
  All to Jesus I surrender;
  now I feel the sacred flame.
  O the joy of full salvation!
  Glory, glory, to his name!










































  312    Near the Cross


  1
  Jesus, keep me near the cross;
  there a precious fountain,
  free to all, a healing stream,
  flows from Calvary's mountain.

  Refrain
  In the cross, in the cross,
  be my glory ever,
  till my raptured soul shall find
  rest beyond the river.

  2
  Near the cross, a trembling soul,
  love and mercy found me;
  there the bright and morning star
  sheds its beams around me.

  3
  Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
  bring its scenes before me;
  help me walk from day to day
  with its shadow o'er me.

  4
  Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
  hoping, trusting ever,
  till I reach the golden strand
  just beyond the river.









































  314    Just as I Am


  1
  Just as I am, without one plea,
  but that thy blood was shed for me,
  and that thou bidst me come to thee,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

  2
  Just as I am, and waiting not
  to rid my soul of one dark blot,
  to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

  3
  Just as I am, though tossed about
  with many a conflict, many a doubt,
  fightings and fears within, without,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

  4
  Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
  sight, riches, healing of the mind,
  yea, all I need in thee to find,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

  5
  Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
  wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
  because thy promise I believe,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

  6
  Just as I am, thy love I own
  hath broken every barrier down;
  now, to be thine, and thine alone,
  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.



































  318    Whiter Than Snow


  1
  Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
  I want Thee forever to live in my soul;
  Break down every idol, cast out every foe;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Refrain
  Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  2
  Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
  And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
  I give up myself, and whatever I know;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  3
  Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
  I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet,
  By faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  4
  Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;
  Come now, and within me a new heart create;
  To those who have sought Thee,
  Thou never said'st No;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.










































  321    My Jesus, I Love Thee


  1
  My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;
  for thee all the follies of sin I resign.
  My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;
  if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

  2
  I love thee because thou hast first loved me,
  and purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
  I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
  if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

  3
  I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
  And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
  And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
  if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

  4
  In mansions of glory and endless delight;
  I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;
  I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
  if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.















































  326    Open My Eyes That I May See


  1
  Open my eyes, that I may see
  Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
  Place in my hands the wonderful key
  That shall unclasp and set me free.
  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my eyes,
  illumine me, Spirit Divine!

  2
  Open my ears that I may hear
  Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
  and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,
  Everything false will disappear.
  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!

  3
  Open my mouth, and let me bear
  Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
  Open my heart, and let me prepare
  Love with Thy children thus to share.
  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!











































  327    I'd Rather Have Jesus


  1
  I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
  I'd rather be His than have riches untold:
  I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
  I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand

  Refrain
  Than to be the king of a vast domain
  Or be held in sin's dread sway.
  I'd rather have Jesus tan anything
  This world affords today.

  2
  I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
  I rather be faithful to His dear cause;
  Id rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
  I'd rather be true to His holy name.

  3
  He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
  He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
  He's all than my hungering spirit needs.
  I'd rather hav Jesus and let Him lead















































  328    Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone


  1
  Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
  and all the world go free?
  No, there's a cross for everyone,
  and there's a cross for me.

  2
  The consecrated cross I'll bear
  till He shall set me free;
  and then go home my crown to wear,
  for there's a crown for me.

  3
  Upon the crystal pavement, down
  at Jesus' pierced feet,
  with joy I'll cast my golden crown,
  and His dear name repeat.





















































  329    Take the World, but Give Me Jesus


  1
  Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
  All its Joys are but a name,
  But His love abideth ever,
  Through eternal years the same.

  Refrain
  Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
  Oh, the length and breadth of love!
  Oh, the fullness of redemption,
  Pledge of endless life above

  2
  Take the wold, but give me Jesus,
  Sweetest comfort of my soul;
  With my Savior watching o'er me,
  I can sing, though billows roll.

  3
  Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
  Let me view his constant smile;
  Then throughout my pilgrim journey
  Light will cheer me all the while.

  4
  Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
  In His cross my trust shall be,
  Till, with clearer, brighter vision
  Face to face my Lord I see.









































  331    O Jesus, I Have Promised


  1
  O Jesus, I have promised
  to serve thee to the end;
  be thou forever near me,
  my Master and my friend.
  I shall not fear the battle
  if thou art by my side,
  nor wander from the pathway
  if thou wilt be my guide.

  2
  O let me feel thee near me!
  The world is ever near;
  I see the sights that dazzle,
  the tempting sounds I hear;
  my foes are ever near me,
  around me and within;
  but Jesus, draw thou nearer,
  and shield my soul from sin.

  3
  O Jesus, thou hast promised
  to all who follow thee
  that where thou art in glory
  there shall thy servant be.
  And Jesus, I have promised
  to serve thee to the end;
  O give me grace to follow,
  my Master and my Friend.









































  334    Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing


  1
  Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
  tune my heart to sing thy grace;
  streams of mercy, never ceasing,
  call for songs of loudest praise.
  Teach me some melodious sonnet,
  sung by flaming tongues above.
  Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
  mount of thy redeeming love.

  2
  Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
  hither by thy help I'm come;
  and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
  safely to arrive at home.
  Jesus sought me when a stranger,
  wandering from the fold of God;
  he, to rescue me from danger,
  interposed his precious blood.

  3
  O to grace how great a debtor
  daily I'm constrained to be!
  Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
  bind my wandering heart to thee.
  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
  prone to leave the God I love;
  here's my heart, O take and seal it,
  seal it for thy courts above.









































  336    There Is a Fountain


  1
  There is a fountain filled with blood
  drawn from Emmanuel's veins;
  and sinners plunged beneath that flood
  lose all their guilty stains.
  Lose all their guilty stains,
  lose all their guilty stains;
  and sinners plunged beneath that flood
  lose all their guilty stains.

  2
  The dying thief rejoiced to see
  that fountain in his day;
  and there may I, though vile as he,
  wash all my sins away.
  Wash all my sins away,
  wash all my sins away;
  and there may I, though vile as he,
  wash all my sins away.

  3
  Thou dying Lamb!, thy precious blood
  shall never lose its power
  till all the ransomed church of God
  be saved, to sin no more.
  Be saved, to sin no more,
  be saved, to sin no more;
  till all the ransomed church of God
  be saved, to sin no more.

  4
  E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
  thy flowing wounds supply,
  redeeming love has been my theme,
  and shall be till I die.
  And shall be till I die,
  and shall be till I die;
  redeeming love has been my theme,
  and shall be till I die.

  5
  Lord, I believe Thow hast prepared,
  Unworthy though I be,
  For me a blood-bought, free reward
  A golden harp for me!
  A golden harp for me!
  A golden harp for me!
  For me a blood-bought, free reward
  A golden harp for me!

  6
  There in a nobler, sweeter song,
  I'll sing thy power to save,
  when this poor lisping, stammering tongue
  Is ransomed form the grave,
  Is ransomed form the grave,
  Is ransomed form the grave,
  when this poor lisping, stammering tongue
  Is ransomed form the grave.




















































































  341    To God Be the Glory


  1
  To God be the glory, great things he hath done!
  So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,
  who yielded his life an atonement for sin,
  and opened the lifegate that all may go in.

  Refrain
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  let the earth hear his voice!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  let the people rejoice!
  O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,
  and give him the glory, great things he hath done!

  2
  O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
  to every believer the promise of God;
  the vilest offender who truly believes,
  that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

  3
  Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,
  and great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son;
  but purer, and higher, and greater will be
  our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.













































  344    I Love Your Kingdom, Lord


  1
  I love thy kingdom, Lord,
  the house of thine abode,
  the church our blest Redeemer saved
  with his own precious blood.

  2
  I love thy church, O God!
  Her walls before thee stand
  dear as the apple of thine eye,
  and graven on thy hand.

  3
  Beyond my highest joy
  I prize her heavenly ways,
  her sweet communion, solemn vows,
  her hymns of love and praise.

  5
  Sure as thy truth shall last,
  to Zion shall be given
  the brightest glories earth can yield,
  and brighter bliss of heaven.















































  348    The Church Has One Foundation


  1
  The church's one foundation
  is Jesus Christ her Lord;
  she is his new creation
  by water and the Word.
  From heaven he came and sought her
  to be his holy bride;
  with his own blood he bought her,
  and for her life he died.

  2
  Elect from every nation,
  yet one o'er all the earth;
  her charter of salvation,
  one Lord, one faith, one birth;
  one holy name she blesses,
  partakes one holy food,
  and to one hope she presses,
  with every grace endued.

  3
  Though with a scornful wonder
  we see her sore oppressed,
  by schisms rent asunder,
  by heresies distressed,
  yet saints their watch are keeping;
  their cry goes up, "How long?"
  And soon the night of weeping
  shall be the morn of song.

  4
  'Mid toil and tribulation,
  and tumult of her war,
  she waits the consummation
  of peace forevermore;
  till, with the vision glorious,
  her longing eyes are blest,
  and the great church victorious
  shall be the church at rest.































  350    Blest Be the Tie That Binds


  1
  Blest be the tie that binds
  our hearts in Christian love;
  the fellowship of kindred minds
  is like to that above.

  2
  Before our Father's throne
  we pour our ardent prayers;
  our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
  our comforts and our cares.

  3
  We share each other's woes,
  our mutual burdens bear;
  and often for each other flows
  the sympathizing tear.

  4
  When we asunder part,
  it gives us inward pain;
  but we shall still be joined in heart,
  and hope to meet again.















































  355    Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life


  1
  Where cross the crowded ways of life,
  where sound the cries of race and clan,
  above the noise of selfish strife,
  we hear your voice, O Son of Man.

  2
  From tender childhood's helplessness,
  from woman's grief, man's burdened toil,
  from famished souls, from sorrow's stress,
  your heart has never known recoil.

  3
  The cup of water given for you still
  holds the freshness of your grace;
  yet long these multitudes to view
  the sweet compassion of your face.

  4
  O Master, from the mountainside
  make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
  among these restless throngs abide;
  O tread the city's streets again.

  5
  Till all the world shall learn your love
  and follow where your feet have trod,
  till, glorious from your heaven above,
  shall come the city of our God.









































  358    Far and Near the Fields Are Teeming


  1
  Far and near the fields are teeming
  with the sheaves of ripened grain;
  Far and near their gold is gleaming
  O'er the summy slope and plain.

  Refrain
  Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
  Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
  Send them now the sheaves to gather,
  Ere the harvest-time pass by.

  2
  Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
  Send them in the noon-tides's glare;
  When the sun's last rays are streaming,
  bid them gather everywhere.

  3
  O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
  gather now the sheaves of gold;
  Heavenward then at evening wending
  Thou shalt come with joy untold.















































  365    O Zion, Haste


  1
  O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
  to tell to all the world that God is light,
  that he who made all nations is not willing
  one soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

  Refrain
  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

  2
  Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation
  that God, in whom they live and move, is love;
  tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,
  and died on earth that we might live above.

  3
  Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;
  give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
  pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
  O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.

  4
  He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,
  Make known to every heart His saving grace;
  Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,
  Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.











































  367    Rescue the Perishing


  1
  Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
  snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
  weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
  tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

  Refrain
  Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
  Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

  2
  Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
  waiting the penitent child to receive;
  plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
  he will forgive if they only believe.

  3
  Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
  strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
  back to the narrow way patiently win them;
  tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.

















































  370    Christ for the World


  1
  Christ for the world we sing,
  the world to Christ we bring,
  with loving zeal;
  the poor, and them that mourn,
  the faint and overborne,
  sinsick and sorrow-worn,
  whom Christ doth heal.

  2
  Christ for the world we sing,
  the world to Christ we bring,
  with fervent prayer;
  the wayward and the lost,
  by restless passions tossed,
  redeemed at countless cost,
  from dark despair.

  3
  Christ for the world we sing,
  the world to Christ we bring,
  with joyful song;
  the newborn souls, whose days,
  reclaimed from error's ways,
  inspired with hope and praise,
  to Christ belong.












































  373    Seeking the Lost


  1
  Seeking the lost-yes, kindly entreating
  Wanderers on the mountain astray
  "Come unto Me," His message repeating,
  Words of the Master speaking today.

  Refrain
  Ladies: (Going afar) (Upon the mountain)
  Men: Going afar Upon the moun-tain
  Ladies: (Bringing the wand'rer back again,) back again
  Men: Bringing the wand'+rer back again, back again
  Ladies: Into the fold of my Redeemer,
  Men: Into the fold of my Redeem-er
  Ladies: (Jesus the Lamb +for sinners slain,) for sinners slain
  Men: Jesus, the lamb +for sinners slain, for sinners slain

  2
  Seeking the lost-and pointing to Jesus
  Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
  Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
  Showing the path to life evermore.

  3
  Thus I would go on missions of mercy
  Following Christ from day unto day,
  Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
  Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way

  *
  NOTE: On the refrain, the men start, the ladies echo, and the voices join again at the
  +'s.







































  385    Crowning Jewel of Creation


  1
  Crowning jewel of creation,
  Blest and hallowed, sanctified;
  Time and changes all transcending,
  Shared forever, glorified.

  Refrain
  Blessed Sabbath made for man,
  Gift from the Creator's hand.

  2
  Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping
  Cease at close of earthly days;
  But Thy Sabbath is eternal,
  Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!

  3
  Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine
  How to truly rest in Thee,
  May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
  And our shelter ever be.

















































  401    In Imitation, Lord of Thee


  1
  In imitation, Lord, of Thee,
  This solemn service we repeat;
  For Thine example full of grace,
  Has made this humble duty sweet.

  2
  Renew each sacred spark of love,
  And vitalize the holy flame;
  May union strong our hearts unite
  While this we do in Jesus' name.

  3
  Our great example Thou shalt be,
  In washing Thy disciples feet;
  And as we follow Thy command,
  Make Thou our fellowship complete.





















































  404    Now Let Us From This Table Rise


  1
  Now let us from this table rise
  Renewed in body, mind, and soul;
  With Christ we die and live again,
  His selfless love has made us whole.

  2
  With minds alert, upheld by grace,
  To spread the word in speech and deed,
  We follow in the steps of Christ,
  At one with all in hope and need.

  3
  To fill each human house with love,
  It is the sacrament of care;
  The work that Christ began to do
  We humbly pledge ourselves to share.

  4
  Then grant us courage, Father God,
  To choose again the pilgrim way
  And help us to accept with joy
  The challenge of tomorrow's day.















































  413    God Has Spoken by His Prophets


  1
  God has spoken by His prophets,
  Spoken His unchanging Word,
  Each from age to age proclaiming
  God, the one, the righteous Lord.
  Mid the world's despair and turmoil,
  One firm anchor holding fast;
  God is King, His throne eternal,
  God the first, and God the last.

  2
  God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
  Christ, the everlasting Son,
  Brightness of the Father's glory,
  With the Father ever one;
  Spoken by the Word incarnate,
  God of God, ere time began,
  Light of light, to earth descending,
  Man, revealing God to man.

  3
  God yet speaks by His own Spirit
  Speaking to the hearts of men,
  In the age-long Word expounding
  God's own message, now as then;
  Through the rise and fall of nations
  One sure faith yet standing fast,
  God is King, His Word unchanging,
  God the first, and God the last.









































  421    For All the Saints


  1
  For all the saints
  who from their labors rest,
  Who thee by faith
  before the world confessed.
  Thy name, O Jesus,
  be forever blest.
  Alleluia!
  Alleluia!

  2
  Thou wast their Rock,
  their Fortress and their Might;
  Thou, Lord, their captain
  in the well-fought fight;
  Thou, in the darkness drear,
  their one true light.
  Alleluia!
  Alleluia!

  3
  O may Thy soldiers,
  faithful, true, and bold,
  Fight as the saints
  who nobly fought of old,
  And win with them
  the victor's crown of gold.
  Alleluia!
  Alleluia!

  4
  And when the strife is fierce,
  the warfare long,
  Steals on the ear
  the distant triumph song,
  And hearts are brave again,
  and arms are strong.
  Alleluia!
  Alleluia!

  5
  From earth's wide bounds,
  from ocean's farthest coast,
  Thro' gates of pearl
  streams in the countless host,
  Singing to Father,
  Son, and Holy Ghost,
  Alleluia!
  Alleluia!






























































































  422    Marching to Zion


  1
  Come, we that love the Lord,
  And let our joys be known;
  Join in a song with sweet accord,
  Join in a song with sweet accord,
  And thus surround the throne,
  And thus surround the throne.

  Refrain
  We're marching to Zion,
  Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
  We're marching upward to Zion,
  The beautiful city of God.

  2
  Let those refuse to sing,
  Who never knew our God;
  But children of the heavenly King,
  But children of the heavenly King,
  May speak their joys abroad,
  May speak their joys abroad.

  3
  The hill of Zion yields
  A thousand sacred sweets,
  Before we reach the heavenly fields,
  Before we reach the heavenly fields,
  Or walk the golden streets,
  Or walk the golden streets.

  4
  Then let our songs abound,
  And every tear be dry;
  We're marching through Immanuel's ground
  We're marching through Immanuel's ground
  To fairer worlds on high,
  To fairer worlds on high.

































  423    Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken


  1
  Glorious things of thee are spoken,
  Zion, city of our God;
  He whose word cannot be broken
  Formed thee for His own abode;
  On the Rock of Ages founded,
  What can shake thy sure repose?
  With salvation's wall surrounded,
  Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

  2
  See the streams of living waters
  Springing from eternal love,
  Well supply thy sons and daughters,
  And all fear and want remove;
  Who can faint when such a river
  Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
  Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
  Never fails from age to age.

  3
  Round each habitation hovering,
  See the cloud and fire appear
  For a glory and a covering,
  Showing that the Lord is near;
  Blest inhabitants of Zion,
  Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
  Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
  Makes them kings and priests to God.

  4
  Savior, if of Zion's city
  I, through grace, a member am,
  Let the world deride or pity,
  I will glory in Thy name;
  Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
  All his boasted pomp and show;
  Solid joys and lasting treasure
  None but Zion's children know.































  428    Sweet By and By


  1
  There's a land that is fairer than day,
  And by faith we can see it afar;
  For the Father waits over the way,
  To prepare us a dwelling place there.

  Refrain
  In the sweet by and by,
  We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
  In the sweet by and by,
  We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

  2
  We shall sing on that beautiful shore
  The melodious songs of the blest,
  And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
  Not a sigh for the blessings of rest.

  3
  To our bountiful Father above,
  We will offer a tribute of praise,
  For the glorious gift of His love,
  And the blessings that hallow our days.















































  432    Shall We Gather at the River


  1
  Shall we gather at the river,
  where bright angel feet have trod,
  with its crystal tide forever
  flowing by the throne of God.

  Refrain
  Yes, we'll gather at the river,
  the beautiful, the beautiful river;
  gather with the sains at the river
  that flows by the throne of God.

  2
  On the margin of the river
  washing up its silver spray,
  we will walk and worship ever,
  all the happy golden day.

  3
  Ere we reach the shining river,
  lay we ev'ry burden down;
  grace our spirits will deliver,
  and provide a robe and crown.

  4
  Soon we'll reach the shining river,
  soon our pilgrimage will cease;
  soon our happy hearts will quiver
  with the melody of peace.









































  452    What Heavenly Music


  1
  What heavenly music steals over the sea!
  Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!
  'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;
  For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.

  2
  On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,
  And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;
  Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!
  Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.

  3
  Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,
  If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave;
  For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,
  I must join in that chorus! I'll go! let me go!





















































  456    My Lord and I


  1
  I have a Friend so precious,
  So very dear to me,
  He loves me with such tender love,
  He loves so faithfully;
  I could not live apart form Him,
  I love to feel Him nigh,
  And so we dwell together,
  My Lord and I.

  2
  Sometimes I'm faint and weary,
  He knows that I am weak,
  And as He bids me lean on Him,
  His help I gladly seek;
  He leads me in the paths of light,
  Beneath a sunny sky,
  And so we walk together,
  My Lord and I.

  3
  I tell Him all my sorrows,
  I tell Him all my joys,
  I tell Him all that pleases me,
  I tell Him what annoys;
  He tells me what I ought to do,
  He tells me how to try,
  And so we talk together,
  My Lord and I.

  4
  He knows that I am longing
  Some weary soul to win,
  And so He bids me go and speak
  The loving word for Him;
  He bids me tell His wondrous love,
  And why He came to die,
  And so we work together,
  My Lord and I.































  457    I Love to Tell the Story


  1
  I love to tell the story
  of unseen things above,
  of Jesus and his glory,
  of Jesus and his love.
  I love to tell the story,
  because I know 'tis true;
  it satisfies my longings
  as nothing else can do.

  Refrain
  I love to tell the story,
  'twill be my theme in glory,
  to tell the old, old story
  of Jesus and his love.

  2
  I love to tell the story;
  more wonderful it seems
  than all the golden fancies
  of all our golden dreams.
  I love to tell the story,
  it did so much for me;
  and that is just the reason
  I tell it now to thee.

  3
  I love to tell the story;
  'tis pleasant to repeat
  what seems, each time I tell it,
  more wonderfully sweet.
  I love to tell the story,
  for some have never heard
  the message of salvation
  from God's own holy Word.

  4
  I love to tell the story,
  for those who know it best
  seem hungering and thirsting
  to hear it like the rest.
  And when, in scenes of glory,
  I sing the new, new song,
  'twill be the old, old story
  that I have loved so long.





























  458    More Love to Thee


  1
  More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!
  Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
  This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;
  more love to thee, more love to thee!

  2
  Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
  now thee alone I seek, give what is best.
  This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
  more love to thee, more love to thee!

  3
  Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;
  sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,
  when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;
  more love to thee, more love to thee!

  4
  Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;
  this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
  this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
  more love to thee, more love to thee!











































  462    Blessed Assurance, Jesus is Mine!

  Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
  O what a foretaste of glory divine!
  Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
  born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

  Refrain
  This is my story, this is my song,
  praising my Savior all the day long;
  this is my story, this is my song,
  praising my Savior all the day long.

  2
  Perfect submission, perfect delight,
  visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
  angels descending bring from above
  echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

  3
  Perfect submission, all is at rest;
  I in my Savior am happy and blest,
  watching and waiting, looking above,
  filled with his goodness, lost in his love.















































  463    Peace, Perfect Peace


  1
  Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
  The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

  2
  Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
  To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.

  3
  Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
  In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.

  4
  Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
  Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.























































  469    Leaning on the Everlasting Arms


  1
  What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
  leaning on the everlasting arms;
  what a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
  leaning on the everlasting arms.

  Refrain
  Leaning, leaning,
  safe and secure from all alarms;
  leaning, leaning,
  leaning on the everlasting arms.

  2
  O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
  leaning on the everlasting arms;
  O how bright the path grows from day to day,
  leaning on the everlasting arms.
  (Refrain)

  3
  What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
  leaning on the everlasting arms?
  I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
  leaning on the everlasting arms.














































  470    There's Sunshine in My Soul Today


  1
  There's sunshine in my soul today,
  More glorious and bright
  Than glows in any earthly sky,
  For Jesus is my light.

  Refrain
  O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
  When the peaceful, happy moments roll
  When Jesus shows His smiling face
  There is sunshine in the soul.

  2
  There's music in my soul today,
  A carol to my King,
  And Jesus, listening, can hear
  The songs I cannot sing.

  3
  There's springtime in my soul today,
  For when the Lord is near,
  The dove of peace sings in my heart,
  The flowers of grace appear.

  4
  Theres gladness in my soul today,
  And hope, and praise, and love,
  For blessings which He gives me now,
  For joys "laid up" above.









































  473    Nearer My God, to Thee


  1
  Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
  E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
  still all my song shall be,
  nearer, my God, to thee;
  nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

  2
  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
  darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
  yet in my dreams I'd be
  nearer, my God, to thee;
  nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

  3
  There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;
  all that thou sendest me, in mercy given;
  angels to beckon me
  nearer, my God, to thee;
  nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

  4
  Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,
  out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
  so by my woes to be
  nearer, my God, to thee;
  nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

  5
  Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
  sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,
  still all my song shall be,
  nearer, my God, to thee;
  nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!




































  477    Come, Ye Disconsolate


  1
  Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish.
  come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
  Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
  earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

  2
  Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
  hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
  Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
  "Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."

  3
  Here see the bread of life; waters flowing
  forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
  Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
  earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.





















































  478    Sweet Hour of Prayer


  1
  Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
  that calls me from a world of care,
  and bids me at my Father's throne
  make all my wants and wishes known.
  In seasons of distress and grief,
  my soul has often found relief,
  and oft escaped the tempter's snare
  by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

  2
  Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
  thy wings shall my petition bear
  to him whose truth and faithfulness
  engage the waiting soul to bless.
  And since he bids me seek his face,
  believe his word, and trust his grace,
  I'll cast on him my every care,
  and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

  3
  Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
  May I thy consolation share
  Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height
  I view my home and take my flight.
  In my immortal flesh I'll rise
  To size the everlasting prize.
  And shout while passing through the air,
  "Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"









































  481    Dear Lord and Father


  1
  Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
  forgive our foolish ways;
  reclothe us in our rightful mind,
  in purer lives thy service find,
  in deeper reverence, praise.

  2
  In simple trust like theirs who heard,
  beside the Syrian sea,
  the gracious calling of the Lord,
  let us, like them, without a word,
  rise up and follow thee.

  3
  O sabbath rest by Galilee,
  O calm of hills above,
  where Jesus knelt to share with thee
  the silence of eternity,
  interpreted by love!

  4
  Drop thy still dews of quietness,
  till all our strivings cease;
  take from our souls the strain and stress,
  and let our ordered lives confess
  the beauty of thy peace.

  5
  Breathe through the heats of our desire
  thy coolness and thy balm;
  let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
  speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
  O still, small voice of calm.




































  483    I Need Thee Every Hour


  1
  I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
  no tender voice like thine can peace afford.

  Refrain
  I need thee, O I need thee;
  every hour I need thee;
  O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee.

  2
  I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
  temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

  3
  I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
  come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

  4
  I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
  and thy rich promises in me fulfill.


















































  484    I Need Thee, Precious Jesus


  1
  I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;
  A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
  I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,
  To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.

  2
  I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,
  To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.
  I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,
  To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb.

  3
  I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
  Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.
  There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be
  To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.





















































  491    In the Hour of Trial


  1
  In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
  Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
  When Thou see'st me waver, with a look recall,
  Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.

  2
  With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
  Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
  Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
  Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

  3
  Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
  Or should pain attend me on my path below,
  Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
  Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.





















































  495    Near to the Heart of God


  1
  There is a place of quiet rest,
  near to the heart of God;
  a place where sin cannot molest,
  near to the heart of God.

  Refrain
  O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
  sent from the heart of God,
  hold us who wait before thee
  near to the heart of God.

  2
  There is a place of comfort sweet,
  near to the heart of God;
  a place where we our Savior meet,
  near to the heart of God.

  3
  There is place a place of full release,
  near to the heart of God;
  a place where all is joy and peace,
  near to the heart of God.















































  499    What a Friend We Have in Jesus


  1
  What a friend we have in Jesus,
  all our sins and griefs to bear!
  What a privilege to carry
  everything to God in prayer!
  O what peace we often forfeit,
  O what needless pain we bear,
  all because we do not carry
  everything to God in prayer.

  2
  Have we trials and temptations?
  Is there trouble anywhere?
  We should never be discouraged;
  take it to the Lord in prayer.
  Can we find a friend so faithful
  who will all our sorrows share?
  Jesus knows our every weakness;
  take it to the Lord in prayer.

  3
  Are we weak and heavy laden,
  cumbered with a load of care?
  Precious Savior, still our refuge;
  take it to the Lord in prayer.
  Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
  Take it to the Lord in prayer!
  In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
  thou wilt find a solace there.









































  500    Take Time to Be Holy


  1
  Take time to be holy,
  speak oft with thy Lord;
  abide in him always,
  and feed on his word.
  Make friends of God's children,
  help those who are weak,
  forgetting in nothing
  his blessing to seek.

  2
  Take time to be holy,
  the world rushes on;
  spend much time in secret
  with Jesus alone.
  By looking to Jesus,
  like him thou shalt be;
  thy friends in thy conduct
  his likeness shall see.

  3
  Take time to be holy,
  let him be thy guide,
  and run not before him,
  whatever betide.
  In joy or in sorrow,
  still follow the Lord,
  and, looking to Jesus,
  still trust in his word.

  4
  Take time to be holy,
  be calm in thy soul,
  each thought and each motive
  beneath his control.
  Thus led by his spirit
  to fountains of love,
  thou soon shalt be fitted
  for service above.































  506    A Mighty Fortress


  1
  A mighty fortress is our God,
  a bulwark never failing;
  our helper he amid the flood
  of mortal ills prevaling.
  For still our ancient foe
  doth seek to work us woe;
  his craft and power are great,
  and armed with cruel hate,
  on earth is not his equal.

  2
  Did we in our own strength confide,
  our striving would be losing,
  were not the right man on our side,
  the man of God's own choosing.
  Dost ask who that may be?
  Christ Jesus, it is he;
  Lord Sabbaoth, his name,
  from age to age the same,
  and he must win the battle.

  3
  And though this world, with devils filled,
  should threaten to undo us,
  we will not fear, for God hath willed
  his truth to triumph through us.
  The Prince of Darkness grim,
  we tremble not for him;
  his rage we can endure,
  for lo, his doom is sure;
  one little word shall fell him.

  4
  That word above all earthly powers,
  no thanks to them, abideth;
  the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
  thru him who with us sideth.
  Let goods and kindred go,
  this mortal life also;
  the body they may kill;
  God's truth abideth still;
  his kingdom is forever.




























  508    Anywhere With Jesus


  1
  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
  Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
  Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;
  Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

  Refrain
  Anywhere!  Anywhere!
  Fear I cannot know;
  Anywhere with Jesus
  I can safely go.

  2
  Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
  Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
  Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
  Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

  3
  Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
  When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,
  Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
  Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.














































  516    All the Way


  1
  All the way my Savior leads me;
  What have I to ask beside?
  Can I doubt His tender mercy,
  Who through life has been my guide?
  Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
  Here by faith in Him to dwell;
  For I know whate'er befall me,
  Jesus doeth all things well;
  For I know whate'er befall me,
  Jesus doeth all things well.

  2
  All the way my Savior leads me;
  Cheers each winding path I tread;
  Gives me grace for every trial,
  Feeds me with the living bread;
  Though my weary steps may falter,
  And my soul athirst may be,
  Gushing from the Rock before me,
  Lo, a spring of joy I see;
  Gushing from the Rock before me,
  Lo, a spring of joy I see.

  3
  All the way my Savior leads me;
  O the fullness of His love!
  Perfect rest to me is promised
  In my Father's house above;
  When I wake to life immortal,
  Wing my flight to realms of day,
  This my song through endless ages,
  Jesus led me all the way;
  This my song through endless ages,
  Jesus led me all the way.



































  517    My Faith Looks Up to Thee


  1
  My faith looks up to thee,
  thou Lamb of Calvary,
  Savior divine;
  Now hear me while I pray,
  take all my guilt away,
  O let me from this day
  be wholly Thine.

  2
  May thy rich grace impart
  strength to my fainting heart,
  my zeal inspire!
  As thou hast died for me,
  O may my love to thee
  pure, warm, and changeless be,
  a living fire!

  3
  While life's dark maze I tread,
  and griefs around me spread,
  be thou my guide;
  bid darkness turn to day,
  wipe sorrow's tears away,
  nor let me ever stray
  from Thee aside.












































  518    Standing on the Promises


  1
  Standing on the promises
  of Christ my King,
  Thru eternal ages
  let His praises ring;
  Glory in the highest
  I will shout and sing,
  Standing on the promises of God.

  Refrain
  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises
  of God my Savior;
  Standing,standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.

  2
  Standing on the promises
  that cannot fail,
  When the howling storms
  of doubt and fear assail,
  By the living word of
  God I shall prevail,
  Standing on the promises of God.

  3
  Standing on the promises
  of Christ the Lord,
  Bound to Him eternally
  by love's strong cord,
  Overcoming daily with
  the Spirit's sword,
  Standing on the promises of God.





































  520    He Hideth My Soul


  1
  A wonderful Savior
  is Jesus my Lord,
  A wonderful
  Savior to me,
  He hideth my soul in
  the cleft of the rock,
  Where rivers of
  pleasure I see.

  Refrain
  He hideth my soul in
  the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a
  dry, thirsty land;
  he hideth my life in
  the depths of His love,
  And covers me
  there with His hand,
  And covers me
  there with His hand.

  2
  A wonderful Savior
  is Jesus my Lord,
  He taketh my
  burden away,
  He holdeth me up, and
  I shall not be moved,
  He giveth me
  strength as my day.

  3
  With numberless blessings
  each moment He crowns,
  And filled with
  His fullness divine,
  I sing in my rapture,
  Oh, Glory to God
  For such a
  Redeemer as mine.

  4
  When clothed in His
  brightness, transported I rise
  To meet Him in
  clouds of the sky,
  His perfect salvation,
  His wonderful love,
  I'll shout with
  the millions on high.




























































































  521    Depth of Mercy


  1
  Depth of mercy!--can there be
  Mercy still reserved for me?
  Can my God His wrath forbear?
  Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

  2
  I have long withstood His grace,
  Long provoked Him to His face,
  Would not hearken to His calls,
  Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

  3
  Now incline me to repent;
  Let me now my sins lament;
  Now my foul revolt deplore,
  Weep, believe, and sin no more.

  4
  There for me the Savior stands,
  Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
  God is love! I know, I feel;
  Jesus weeps, and loves me still.















































  522    My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less


  1
  My hope is built on nothing less
  than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
  I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
  but wholly leand on Jesus' name.

  Refrain
  On Christ the solid rock I stand;
  all other ground is sinking sand,
  all other ground is sinking sand.

  2
  When Darkness veils his lovely face,
  I rest on his unchanging grace.
  in every high and stormy gale,
  my anchor holds within the veil.

  3
  His oath, his covenant, his blood
  supports me in the whelming flood.
  When all around my soul gives way,
  he then is all my hope and stay.

  4
  When He shall come with trumpet sound,
  O may I then in him be found!
  Dressed in his righteousness alone,
  faultless to stand before the throne.










































  524    'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus


  1
  'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
  and to take him at his word;
  just to rest upon his promise,
  and to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

  Refrain
  Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
  How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
  Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust him more!

  2
  O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
  just to trust his cleansing blood;
  and in simple faith to plunge me
  neath the healing, cleansing flood!

  3
  Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
  just from sin and self to cease;
  just from Jesus simply taking
  life and rest, and joy and peace.

  4
  I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,
  precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
  and I know that thou art with me,
  wilt be with me to the end.









































  525    Hiding in Thee








































































  529    Under His Wings


  1
  Under His wings I am safely abiding;
  Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
  Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
  he has redeemed me, and I am His child.

  Refrain
  Under His wings, under His wings,
  Who from His love can sever?
  Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
  Safely abide forever.

  2
  Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
  How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
  Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
  There I find comfort, and there I am blest.

  3
  Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
  There will I hide till life's trials are over;
  Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
  Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.















































  530    It Is Well With My Soul


  1
  When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
  when sorrows like sea billows roll;
  whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
  It is well, it is well with my soul.

  Refrain
  It is well with my soul,
  it is well, it is well with my soul.

  2
  My sin, -oh, the joy of this glorious thought-
  My sin, not in part but the whole,
  is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
  praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

  3
  And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
  the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
  the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
  even so, it is well with my soul.

















































  537    He Leadeth Me


  1
  He leadeth me: O blessed thought!
  O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
  Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
  still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

  Refrain
  He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
  by his own hand he leadeth me;
  his faithful follower I would be,
  for by his hand he leadeth me.

  2
  Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
  sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
  by waters still, o'er troubled sea,
  still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.

  3
  Lord, I would place my hand in thine,
  nor ever murmur nor repine;
  content, whatever lot I see,
  since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

  4
  And when my task on earth is done,
  when by thy grace the victory's won,
  e'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
  since God through Jordan leadeth me.









































  538    Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah


  1
  Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
  pilgrim through this barren land.
  I am weak, but thou art mighty;
  hold me with thy powerful hand.
  Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
  feed me till I want no more;
  feed me till I want no more.

  2
  Open now the crystal fountain,
  whence the healing stream doth flow;
  let the fire and cloudy pillar
  lead me all my journey through.
  Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
  be thou still my strength and shield;
  be thou still my strength and shield.

  3
  When I tread the verge of Jordan,
  bid my anxious fears subside;
  death of death and hell's destruction,
  land me safe on Canaan's side.
  Songs of praises, songs of praises,
  I will ever give to thee;
  I will ever give to thee.












































  541    Lord, Speak to Me


  1
  Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
  in living echoes of thy tone;
  as thou has sought, so let me seek
  thine erring children lost and lone.

  2
  O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
  the wandering and the wavering feet;
  O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
  thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

  3
  O strengthen me, that while I stand
  firm on the rock, and strong in thee,
  I may stretch out a loving land
  to wrestlers with the troubled sea.





















































  545    Savior, Like a Shepherd


  1
  Savior, like a shepherd lead us,
  much we need thy tenderest care;
  in thy pleasant pastures feed us,
  for our use thy folds prepare.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  Thou hast bought us, thine we are.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

  2
  We are thine, thou dost befriend us,
  be the guardian of our way;
  keep thy flock, from sin defend us,
  seek us when we go astray.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  Hear, O hear us when we pray.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  Hear, O hear us when we pray.

  3
  Thou hast promised to receive us,
  poor and sinful though we be;
  thou hast mercy to relieve us,
  grace to cleanse and power to free.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  We will early turn to thee.
  Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
  We will early turn to thee.









































  548    Now Praise the Hidden God of Love


  1
  Now praise the hidden God of love
  In whom we all must live and move,
  Who shepherds us, at every stage
  Thro' youth, maturity, and age.

  2
  Who challenged us, when were young
  To storm the citadels of wrong;
  In care for others taught us how
  God's true community must grow.

  3
  Who bids us never lose our zest,
  Tho' age is urging us to rest,
  But proves to us that we have still
  A work to do, a place to fill.

  4
  Then talk no more of wasted time,
  But Godward look, and upward climb,
  Content to sleep, when day is done,
  And rise refreshed, and travel on.















































  551    Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me


  1
  Jesus, Savior, pilot me
  over life's tempestuous sea;
  unknown waves before me roll,
  hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
  Chart and compass come from thee;
  Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

  2
  As a mother stills her child,
  thou canst hush the ocean wild;
  boisterous waves obey thy will,
  when thou sayest to them, "Be still!"
  Wondrous sovreign of the sea,
  Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

  3
  When at last I near the shore,
  and the fearful breakers roar
  'twixt me and the peaceful rest,
  then, while leaning on thy breast,
  may I hear thee say to me,
  "Fear not, I will pilot thee."















































  554    O Let Me Walk With Thee


  1
  O let me walk with Thee, my God,
  As Enoch walked in days of old;
  Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,
  And sweet communion with me hold;
  E'en though the path I may not see,
  Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.

  2
  I cannot, dare not, walk alone;
  The tempest rages in the sky,
  A thousand snares beset my feet,
  A thousand foes are lurking nigh.
  Still Thou the raging of the sea,
  O Master! let me walk with Thee.

  3
  If I may rest my hand in Thine,
  I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
  And firmly, bravely journey on;
  I'll bear the banner of the cross
  Till Zion's glorious gates I see;
  Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.















































  559    Now Thank We All Our God


  1
  Now thank we all our God,
  with heart and hands and voices,
  who wondrous things has done,
  in whom this world rejoices;
  who from our mothers' arms
  has blessed us on our way
  with countless gifts of love,
  and still is ours today.

  2
  O may this bounteous God
  through all our life be near us,
  with ever joyful hearts
  and blessed peace to cheer us;
  and keep us still in grace,
  and guide us when perplexed;
  and free us from all ills,
  in this world and the next.

  3
  All praise and thanks to God
  the Father now be given;
  the Son, and him who reigns
  with them in highest heaven;
  the one eternal God,
  whom earth and heaven adore;
  for thus it was, is now,
  and shall be evermore.









































  565    For the Beauty of the Earth

  over and around us lies;
  Lord of all, to Thee we raise
  this our grateful song of praise.

  For the joy of human love,
  brother, sister, parent, child,
  friends on earth and friends above,
  Pleasures pure and undefiled,
  Lord of all, to Thee we raise
  this our grateful song of praise.

  3
  For the gift of Thy dear Son,
  for the hope of heaven at last,
  for the Spirit's victory won,
  For the crown when life is past,
  Lord of all, to Thee we raise
  Songs of gratitude and praise.















































  567    Have Thine Own Way, Lord


  1
  Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
  Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
  Mold me and make me after thy will,
  while I am waiting, yielded and still.

  2
  Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
  Search me and try me, Savior today!
  Wash me just now, Lord, wash me just now,
  as in thy presence humbly I bow.

  3
  Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
  Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
  Power, all power, surely is thine!
  Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

  4
  Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
  Hold o'er my being absolute sway.
  Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see
  Christ only, always, living in me!















































  569    Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior


  1
  Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
  hear my humble cry;
  while on others thou art calling,
  do not pass me by.

  Refrain
  Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
  while on others thou art calling,
  do not pass me by.

  2
  Let me at thy throne of mercy
  find a sweet relief,
  kneeling there in deep contrition;
  help my unbelief.

  3
  Trusting only in thy merit,
  would I seek thy face;
  heal my wounded, broken spirit,
  save me by thy grace.

  4
  Thou the spring of all my comfort,
  more than life to me,
  whom have I on earth beside thee?
  Whom in heaven but thee?










































  572    Give of Your Best to the Master


  1
  Give of your best to the master,
  Give of the strength of your youth;
  Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor
  Into the battle for truth.
  Jesus has set the example -
  Dauntless was He, young and brave;
  Give Him your loyal devotion,
  Give Him the best that you have

  Refrain
  Give of your best to the master,
  Give of the strength of your youth;
  Clad in salvation's full armor,
  Join in the battle for truth.

  2
  Give of your best to the Master,
  Give Him first place in your heart;
  Give Him first place in your service,
  Consecrate every part.
  Give, and to you shall be given -
  God His beloved Son gave;
  Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
  Give Him the best that you have.

  3
  Give of your best to the Master,
  Naught else is worthy His love;
  He gave Himself for your ransom,
  Have up His glory above;
  Laid down His life without murmur,
  You from sin's ruin to save;
  Give Him your heart's adoration,
  Give Him the best that you have.



































  574    O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee


  1
  O Master, let me walk with thee
  in lowly paths of service free;
  tell me thy secret; help me bear
  the strain of toil, the fret of care.

  2
  Help me the slow of heart to move
  by some clear, winning word of love;
  teach me the wayward feet to stay,
  and guide them in the homeward way.

  3
  Teach me thy patience; still with thee
  in closer, dearer company,
  in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
  in trust that triumphs over wrong;

  4
  In hope that sends a shining ray
  far down the future's broadening way,
  in peace that only thou canst give,
  with thee, O Master, let me live.















































  576    Awake, Awake to Love and Work


  1
  Awake, awake to love and work!
  The lark is in the sky;
  The fields are wet with diamond dew;
  The worlds awake to cry
  Their blessings on the Lord of life,
  As He goes meekly by.

  2
  Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
  Shout with their shout of praise;
  See how the giant sun soars up,
  Great lord of years and days!
  So let the love of Jesus come
  And set thy soul ablaze.

  3
  To give and give, and give again,
  What God hath given thee;
  To spend thyself nor count the cost;
  To serve right gloriously
  The God who gave all worlds that are,
  And all that are to be.















































  590    Trust and Obey


  1
  When we walk with the Lord
  in the light of his word,
  what a glory he sheds on our way!
  While we do his good will,
  he abides with us still,
  and with all who will trust and obey.

  Refrain
  Trust and obey, for there's no other way
  to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

  2
  Not a shadow can rise,
  not a cloud in the skies,
  but his smile quickly drives it away;
  not a doubt nor a fear,
  not a sigh nor a tear,
  can abide while we trust and obey.

  3
  Not a burden we bear,
  not a sorrow we share,
  but our toil he doth richly repay;
  not a grief or a loss,
  not a frown or a cross,
  but is blest if we trust and obey.

  4
  But we never can prove
  the delights of his love
  until all on the altar we lay;
  for the favor he shows,
  and the joy he bestows,
  are for them who will trust and obey.
  (Refrain)

  5
  Then in fellowship sweet
  we will sit at his feet,
  or we'll walk by his side in the way;
  what he says we will do,
  where he sends we will go;
  never fear, only trust and obey.




























  591    In Our Work and in Our Play


  1
  In our work and in our play,
  Jesus, ever with us stay;
  May be always strive to be
  True and faithful unto Thee.

  We are children of the King.

  May we in Thy strength subdue
  Evil tempers, words untrue,
  Thoughts impure, and deeds unkind,
  All things hateful to Thy mind.
  Then we truthfully can sing,
  We are children of the King.

  3
  Children of the King are we!
  May we loyal to Him be;
  Try to please Him every day,
  In our work and in our play.
  Then we truthfully can sing,
  We are children of the King.













































  594    Heir of the Kingdom


  1
  Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
  Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
  Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
  Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.

  2
  Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?
  How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?
  Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;
  Haste to receive Him descending the skies.

  3
  Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
  Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
  Listen, 'tis nought but the chariot's loud rumbling;
  Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.

  4
  Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!
  See how its glory is passing away;
  Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;
  Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.

  5
  Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
  Watch for the glory of earth's coming King;
  Lo! o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;
  Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.









































  595    Let Every Lamp Be Burning


  1
  Let every lamp be burning bright,
  The darkest hour is nearing;
  The darkest hour of earth's long night,
  Before the Lord's appearing.

  Refrain
  Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
  Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
  The Master's coming draweth near,
  Let every lamp be burning.

  2
  Though thousands calmly slumber on,
  The last great message spuring,
  Wel'll rest our living faith upon
  His promise of returning.

  3
  His word our lamp, His truth our guide,
  We cannot be mistaken;
  Though dangers rise on every side,
  We shall not be forsaken.

  4
  Then let good works with faith appear,
  To help the world atound us;
  Obedience bring the blessing near
  When faith has firmly bound us.









































  601    Watchmen, on the Walls of Zion


  1
  Watchmen, on the walls of Zion,
  What O tell us, of the night?
  Is the daystar now arising?
  Will the morn soon greet our sight?
  O'er your vision Shine there now
  some rays of light?
  O'er your vision Shine there now
  some rays of light?

  2
  Tell, O tell us, are the landmarks
  On our voyage all passed by?
  Are we nearing now the haven?
  Can we e'en the land descry?
  Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?
  Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?

  3
  Light is beaming, day is coming!
  Let us sound aloud the cry;
  We behold the daystar rising
  Pure and bright in yonder sky!
  Saints, be joyful; Your redemption draweth nigh;
  Saints, be joyful; Your redemption draweth nigh.

  4
  We have found the chart and compass,
  And are sure the land is near;
  Onward, onward we are hasting,
  Soon the haven will appear;
  Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer;
  Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer.





































  604    We Know Not the Hour


  1
  We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;
  Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
  When He shall return 'tis the promise most cheering
  But we know not the hour.

  Refrain
  He will come, let us watch and be ready;
  He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
  He will come in the clouds of His Father's
  bright glory but we know not the hour.

  2
  There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
  There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
  Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
  But we know not the hour.

  3
  We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
  We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
  We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
  But we know not the hour.















































  609    Am I a Soldier of the Cross?


  1
  Am I a soldier of the cross,
  a follower of the Lamb,
  and shall I fear to own his cause,
  or blush to speak his name?

  2
  Must I be carried to the skies
  on flowery beds of ease,
  while others fought to win the prize,
  and sailed through bloody seas?

  3
  Are there no foes for me to face?
  Must I not stem the flood?
  Is this vile world a friend to grace,
  to help me on to God?

  4
  Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
  increase my courage, Lord.
  I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
  supported by thy word.

  5
  Thy saints in all this glorious war
  shall conquer though they die;
  they see the triumph from afar,
  by faith they bring it nigh.

  6
  When that illustrious day shall rise,
  and all thy armies shine
  in robes of victory through the skies,
  the glory shall be thine.



































  612    Onward, Christian Soldiers!


  1
  Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,
  with the cross of Jesus going on before.
  Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;
  forward into battle see his banners go!

  Refrain
  Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,
  with the cross of Jesus going on before.

  2
  Like a mighty army moves the church of God;
  brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.
  We are not divided, all one body we,
  one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

  3
  Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane,
  but the church of Jesus constant will remain.
  Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
  we have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.

  4
  Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,
  blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.
  Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,
  this through countless ages men and angels sing.











































  614    Sound the Battle Cry


  1

  Rouse, then soldiers!
  rally round the banner!
  Ready, steady, pass the word along;
  Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
  Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

  2
  Strong to meet the foe,
  Marching on we go,
  While our cause we know
  Must prevail;
  Shield and banner bring,
  Gleaming in the light,
  Battling for the right,
  We ne'er can fail.

  3
  O Thou God of all,
  Hear us when we call,
  Help us, one and all,
  By Thy grace;
  When the battle's done,
  And the victory won,
  May we wear the crown
  Before Thy face.



































  615    Rise Up, O Church of God


  1
  Rise up, O men of God!
  His kingdom tarries long.
  Bring in the day of brotherhood
  and end the night of wrong.

  2
  Let women all rise up!
  Have done with lesser things.
  Give heart and mind and soul and strength
  to serve the King of kings.

  3
  Rise up, O men of God!
  The church for you doth wait,
  her strength unequal to her task;
  rise up, and make her great!

  4
  Lift high the cross of Christ!
  Tread where his feet have trod.
  Disciples of the Son of Man,
  rise up, O church of God!















































  618    Stand Up! Stand Up for Jesus!


  1
  Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  ye soldiers of the cross;
  lift high his royal banner,
  it must not suffer loss.
  From victory unto victory
  his army shall he lead,
  till every foe is vanquished,
  and Christ is Lord indeed.

  2
  Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  the trumpet call obey;
  forth to the mighty conflict,
  in this his glorious day.
  Ye that are brave now serve him
  against unnumbered foes;
  let courage rise with danger,
  and strength to strength oppose.

  3
  Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  stand in his strength alone;
  the arm of flesh will fail you,
  ye dare not trust your own.
  Put on the gospel armor,
  each piece put on with prayer;
  where duty calls or danger,
  be never wanting there.

  4
  Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  the strife will not be long;
  this day the noise of battle,
  the next the victor's song.
  To those who vanquish evil
  a crown of life shall be;
  they with the King of Glory
  shall reign eternally.































  619    Lead On, O King Eternal


  1
  Lead on, O King eternal,
  the day of march has come;
  henceforth in fields of conquest
  thy tents shall be our home.
  Through days of preparation
  thy grace has made us strong;
  and now, O King eternal,
  we lift our battle song.

  2
  Lead on, O King eternal,
  till sin's fierce war shall cease,
  and holiness shall whisper
  the sweet amen of peace.
  For not with swords loud clashing,
  nor roll of stirring drums;
  with deeds of love and mercy
  the heavenly kingdom comes.

  3
  Lead on, O King eternal,
  we follow, not with fears,
  for gladness breaks like morning
  where'er thy face appears.
  Thy cross is lifted o'er us,
  we journey in its light;
  the crown awaits the conquest;
  lead on, O God of might.









































  623    I Will Follow Thee

  Thou didst shed Thy blood for me;
  And though all men should forsake Thee;
  By Thy grace I'll follow Thee.

  Though the road be rough and thorny,
  Trackless as the foaming sea,
  Thou hast trod this way before me,
  And I'll gladly follow Thee.

  3
  Though I meet with tribulations,
  Sorely tempted though I be;
  I remember Thou wast tempted,
  And rejoice to follow Thee.

  4
  Though Thou leadest me through affliction,
  Poor, forsaken though I be;
  Thou wast destitute, afflicted,
  And I only follow Thee.

  5
  Though to Jordan's rolling billows,
  Cold and deep, Thou leadest me,
  Thou hast crossed the waves before me,
  And I still will follow Thee.



































  624    I Want Jesus to Walk With Me


  1
  I want Jesus to walk with me.
  I want Jesus to walk with me.
  All along my pilgrim journey,
  I want Jesus to walk with me.

  2
  In my trials Lord, walk with me.
  In my trials Lord, walk with me.
  When the shades of life are falling,
  I want Jesus to walk with me.

  3
  In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me.
  In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me.
  When my heart within is aching,
  I want Jesus to walk with me.





















































  626    In a Little While We're Going Home


  1
  Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,
  In a little while we're going home;
  For the night will end in the everlasting day,
  In a little while we're going home.

  Refrain
  In a little while, In a little while,
  We shall cross the billow's foam;
  We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,
  In a little while we're going home.

  2
  We will do the work that our hands may find to do,
  In a little while we're going home;
  And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,
  In a little while we're going home.

  3
  We will smooth the path for some weary, way-worn feet,
  In a little while we're going home;
  And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
  In a little while we're going home.

  4
  There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care,
  In a little while we're going home;
  And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,
  In a little while we're going home.









































  632    Until Then


  1
  My heart can sing when I pause to remember,
  A heartache here is but a stepping stone.
  Along a trail, thats  winding always upward,
  this troubled world, is not my final home.

  Refrain
  But until then, my heart will go on singing,
  Until then, with joy I'll carry on,
  Until the day my eyes behold the city,
  Until the day God calls me home.

  2
  The things of earth will dim and loose there value,
  If we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
  And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
  Remember there, will only bring a smile.





















































  645    God of our fathers


  1
  God of our fathers,
  whose almighty hand
  Leads forth in beauty
  all the starry band
  Of shining world in

  led us in the past,

  646    To the Name That Brings Salvation


  1
  To the name that brings salvation
  Let the nations bow the head;
  Let them kneel in adoration
  When this name of names is said;
  Let them pray for restoration
  Of all things in Christ the head.

  2
  He through every generation
  Rules in endless majesty;
  May the kings of every nation
  Now foreswear their enmity,
  And with humble veneration
  In the love of God agree.

  3
  Lord, we pray for upright rulers:
  Guard them surely in their need
  From the vanity of power
  And the emptiness of greed;
  Let them see the truth of lowness,
  And on justice let them feed.















































  655    Happy the Home


  1
  Happy the home when God is there,
  and love fills every breast;
  when one their wish, and one their prayer,
  and one their heavenly rest.

  2
  Happy the home where Jesus' name
  is sweet to every ear;
  where children early speak his fame,
  and parents hold him dear.

  3
  Happy the home where prayer is heard,
  and praise is wont to rise;
  where parents love the sacred Word
  and all its wisdom prize.

  4
  Lord, let us in our homes agree
  this blessed peace to gain;
  unite our hearts in love to thee,
  and love to all will reign.















































  656    O Perfect Love


  1
  O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
  lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne,
  that theirs may be the love which knows no ending,
  whom thou forevermore dost join in one.

  2
  O perfect Life, be thou their full assurance
  of tender charity and steadfast faith,
  of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
  with childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.

  3
  Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;
  grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,
  and to life's day the glorious unknown morrow
  that dawns upon eternal love and life.
